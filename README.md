# UDP_Calc

Similar to my TCP_Document_Statistics repository, this repo contains the client and server-side scripts for a UDP calculator. 
The client can input data which is then sent to the server. The server solves the task and returns the answer to the client.

The script was created to show fundamental knowledge about Python's Socket Programming library in the first year of my degree for CMP109 Computer Networking 1.
